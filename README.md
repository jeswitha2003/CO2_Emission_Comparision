# CO2_Emission_Comparision
A real-world data analysis project comparing CO₂ emissions from petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles in Germany. Includes calculations of CO₂ saved by switching to EVs based on actual emission factors and energy consumption rates.

# CO₂ Emission Reduction by Switching to EVs – A Comparative Analysis

This project analyses and compares the carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles (petrol and diesel) with Electric Vehicles (EVs) over varying driving distances. It uses 'real-world emission factors' and 'Germany’s average grid CO₂ emission intensity' to estimate how much emissions can be reduced by switching to EVs.

## Objective
To demonstrate how switching from petrol/diesel to electric vehicles can significantly reduce transport-related carbon emissions, especially in regions with cleaner electricity grids.

 ## Data & Methodology
- ICE Emissions:
  - Petrol: 154 g CO₂/km (based on 15 km/l and 2.31 kg/l fuel factor)
  - Diesel: 134 g CO₂/km (based on 20 km/l and 2.68 kg/l fuel factor)
- EV Consumption: 0.18 kWh/km
- Grid CO₂ Factor (Germany):371 g CO₂/kWh (source: UBA 2023)

Calculated for distances from 10 km to 100 km.

 Key Insights
- CO₂ savings increase linearly with distance driven.
- EVs produce 50–70% lower CO₂ than petrol or diesel cars, even when charged from a mixed-energy grid like Germany's.

## Files Included
- `CO2_Emission_Comparison.csv` – Clean dataset used for analysis
