# CO2_Emission_Comparision
A real-world data analysis project comparing CO‚ÇÇ emissions from petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles in Germany. Includes calculations of CO‚ÇÇ saved by switching to EVs based on actual emission factors and energy consumption rates.

# CO‚ÇÇ Emission Reduction by Switching to EVs ‚Äì A Comparative Analysis

This project analyses and compares the carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles (petrol and diesel) with Electric Vehicles (EVs) over varying driving distances. It uses 'real-world emission factors' and 'Germany‚Äôs average grid CO‚ÇÇ emission intensity' to estimate how much emissions can be reduced by switching to EVs.

## üîç Objective
To demonstrate how switching from petrol/diesel to electric vehicles can significantly reduce transport-related carbon emissions, especially in regions with cleaner electricity grids.

## üìä Data & Methodology
- ICE Emissions:
  - Petrol: 154 g CO‚ÇÇ/km (based on 15 km/l and 2.31 kg/l fuel factor)
  - Diesel: 134 g CO‚ÇÇ/km (based on 20 km/l and 2.68 kg/l fuel factor)
- EV Consumption: 0.18 kWh/km
- Grid CO‚ÇÇ Factor (Germany):371 g CO‚ÇÇ/kWh (source: UBA 2023)

Calculated for distances from 10 km to 100 km.

## üí° Key Insights
- CO‚ÇÇ savings increase linearly with distance driven.
- EVs produce 50‚Äì70% lower CO‚ÇÇ than petrol or diesel cars, even when charged from a mixed-energy grid like Germany's.

## üìÅ Files Included
- `CO2_Emission_Comparison.csv` ‚Äì Clean dataset used for analysis
- Python notebooks/scripts for calculations and plots
- Visualisations: Line graph (total emissions) and bar chart (CO‚ÇÇ saved)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib

## ‚úÖ Applications
- Mobility and sustainability policy planning
- EV adoption awareness
- Portfolio and interview discussions for data analyst roles in the energy or automotive domain
